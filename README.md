This project was the third in line in our Bootcamp and it consists of R and Powerbi where we cleanse the raw data in R and then import the data in PowerBI to show the visualization like Graphs, charts etc. I have learnt the basics of Data cleansing in this project in R and learn the functions from viewing the Data to removing Null values and then detecting outliers and removing them as well. Finally i tranasferred the clean data into PowerBi, where i double checked the data in Power query and then after importing the data i have made different Charts and Graphs to showcase my work and to give an overview of the whole profitability scenario for Hollywood movies industry from 2007 to 2011.
